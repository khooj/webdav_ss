# webdav_ss

Webdav simple server with S3 support and file encryption.

## Project status

Currently project in early (very early) stages of development and not usable at all.

## Why?

I used NextCloud as personal file-server with file synchronization with S3 backend,
but due to its PHP nature it is not confortable to use with low-cost VPS.

So basically this projects aims to be something like `Minio` but with WebDAV interface and with S3 backend support with file encryption.
