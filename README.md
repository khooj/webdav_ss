# webdav_ss

Webdav simple server with S3 support.

## Project status

Currently project in early stages of development and probably not usable.

## Why?

I used NextCloud as personal fileserver with file synchronization with S3 backend,
but due to its PHP nature it is not confortable to use with low-cost VPS.

So basically this projects aims to be something like `Minio` but with WebDAV interface and with S3 backend support.
